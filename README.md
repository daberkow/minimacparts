# minimacparts
3D Printer, Laser Cutting, scripts, and configs needed to complete my mini Mac project, [https://buildingtents.wordpress.com/tag/mini-mac/](https://buildingtents.wordpress.com/tag/mini-mac/).

I used a Makerbot to make the 3D parts.

A Epilog laser to cut the laser parts.

Software is laid out the way the Raspberry Pis OS is. The scripts should be able to be dropped in with minimal edits.
